# LLM-Powered Resume Optimizer to Beat ATS Filters

## ðŸš€ Recent Updates - OpenAI Integration

**This fork has been updated to use OpenAI API instead of Groq LLM for enhanced compatibility and performance:**

### Changes Made:
- **âœ… OpenAI API Integration**: Replaced Groq LLM with OpenAI GPT-4o model
- **âœ… Environment Variables**: Removed hardcoded API key paths, now uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- **âœ… Cross-Platform Support**: Fixed Windows-specific paths for better compatibility across Linux, Mac, and Windows
- **âœ… Improved Security**: API keys are now handled through environment variables instead of local files
- **âœ… Updated Dependencies**: Updated `requirements.txt` with OpenAI-related packages

### Quick Setup:
1. Set your OpenAI API key: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API key
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the application: `streamlit run app.py`
